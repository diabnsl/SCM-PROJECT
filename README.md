1. Menu Layout & Structure
A well-designed café menu page is essential for guiding visitors through available food and drinks. Using HTML, the menu can be structured into distinct sections such as:
- Hot Beverages – Coffee, tea, hot chocolate.
- Cold Beverages – Smoothies, iced coffee, milkshakes.
- Bakery & Snacks – Cakes, muffins, sandwiches.

2. Styling With CSS
The CSS design plays a key role in setting the ambiance for the café website. Some styling techniques include:
- Elegant fonts like cursive or modern sans-serif to match the café's theme.
- Soft, warm color palette (beige, brown, pastel shades) to create a cozy feel.

- Hover effects for interactive buttons, like "Order Now" or "View Details."
